## Course Information

**Instructor:** Amy Traylor 
**Email:** trayloramy@unm.edu  
**Office Hours:** Office Hours: In-person MW from 2-3pm in our classroom. I am always willing to set up zoom or phone calls if needed. Never wait until the last minute to ask questions. You may email or text me between 8am and 6pm. I may not always respond immediately, but barring extenuating circumstances, it should be within 24 hours.

## Introduction

What we’re doing in this lab

This class treats “math” as something that happens in relation. We won’t ask what math is; we’ll track what math does (and what it makes possible or impossible) as it moves through bodies, stories, institutions, classrooms, images, code, machines, and materials.
We will practice diffractive reading, which means reading multiple “lenses” through one another to notice how meaning and value are produced, what gets emphasized, and what gets excluded.
There will be no exams, quizzes, or required notetaking. There will be massive amounts of thinking, discussing, doing, dreaming, and being accountable to one another, the community, and the universe at large.

## What is diffractive reading?
In this course, diffractive reading means examining how different materials and perspectives reshape one another when they come into contact. Rather than treating math, art, code, and lived experience as separate domains, we will read them through each other to notice interference patterns: places where meanings overlap, clash, or generate new possibilities. A diffractive approach helps us see that “math” is not just an abstract set of symbols; it becomes something different depending on the stories, tools, institutions, and bodies involved. Our goal is not to decide the single correct definition of math, but to develop practices for noticing what math does in the world and for building new capacities to think, make, and relate across disciplines.

## Course Purpose
The purpose of this course is to learn to "see" diffractively as a method for resiliency and agency and to develop an affirmative ethics as a mechanism of access to silo-ed knowledge. 
This lab is a required co-requisite with Math 1130: Survey of Math. While I do aspire to support the learning goals and topics covered in your section of 1130, my main goal is to find avenues for you to utilize math in a way that is authentic to each individual student's needs and interests. When we do approach material also covered in 1130 it will always be in a spirit of exploration, play, and making. With that said, if at any time you need support with specific topics or problems in Survey of Math, please reach out and I will be delighted to support you.

## Course Goals

After taking this course, students will be able to:
1. 	Approach math and other things with the question, "what does it do?"
2. 	Learn to apply your own lens to things (ideas/concepts/equations) presented to you in order to negotiate your own relationships with the thing.
3.	Learn to recognize and understand the lenses other people use to present things (ideas/concepts/equations) to you and make decisions about if, when, how, and how much to incorporate other people's lenses into your own. 
4. 	Learn to find something in "math", not necessarily math education, that is relevant and useful for you.

## Required Materials

Laptop: Needed for completing online activities and accessing digital tools
Art/craft supplies you want to bring: scissors, glue, video camera, yarn, arduinos
A willingness to be present, put away your phones, and engage with the material and your classmates.

## Grading

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| In class work completion | 25% |
| Homework | 25% |
| Projects (3) | 50% |

Students will receive one of the following grades at the end of the semester:
97-100=A+; 93-96=A; 90-92=A-; 87-89=B+; 83-86=B; 80-82=B-; 77-79=C+; 73-76=C; 70-72=C-; 67-69=D+; 63-66=D; 60-62=D-; <60=F;  
A final grade of C or higher is required to pass this course. 

Grading is based on:

In-Class Work Completion (25%): Completing all assigned tasks during class time, including projects, diffractions, and academic success activities. Students are expected to actively contribute to discussions, group activities, and lessons during class. Attendance is part of this grade, because if you aren't there, it is hard to complete in-class assignments.
Homework (25%): Expect to spend at least 4 hours outside of class time completing homework assignments. These assignments will all be turned in through Canvas. Assignments may be both the creation and consumption of: short or long writings, sound, music, video, textiles, sculpture, installation, etc, etc, etc. 
Projects (50%): We will have at least 2 multi-week transdisciplinary multimodal projects this semester. Depending on the course flow and interest levels we may create a collective project as a course exhibit. We will discuss and I will keep you posted.
I differentiate grading based on student participation, effort, and communication. I am always happy to discuss and collaborate on a plan for you to accomplish your goals for this class. Please plan for a minimum of four hours of out-of-class work weekly to complete projects.

## Policies

## Attendance, Behavior Expectations & Community Standards 
Respectful Conduct Expectations: I am committed to building with you a positive classroom environment in which everyone can learn. I reserve the right to intervene and enforce standards of respectful behavior when classroom conduct is inconsistent with University expectations [and/or classroom community agreements]. Interventions and enforcement may include but are not limited to required meetings to discuss classroom expectations, written notification of expectations, and/or removal from a class meeting. Repeated violation of classroom norms, ignoring of direct requests from the instructor, and removal from a class meeting will result in an unexcused absence. 3 or more unexcused absences may result in permanent removal and a drop from the course (see attendance policy). 
The University of New Mexico ensures freedom of academic inquiry, free expression and open debate, and a respectful campus through adherence to the following policies: D75: Classroom Conduct, Student Code of Conduct, University Policy 2240 – Respectful Campus, University Policy 2210 – Campus Violence.
