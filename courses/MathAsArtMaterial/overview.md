## Overview

**What we’re doing in this lab course...*

This class treats “math” as something that happens in relation. We won’t ask what math is; we’ll track what math does (and what it makes possible or impossible) as it moves through bodies, stories, institutions, classrooms, images, code, machines, and materials. 

We will practice diffractive reading, which means reading multiple “lenses” through one another to notice how meaning and value are produced, what gets emphasized, and what gets excluded. \
There will be no exams, quizzes, or required notetaking. There will be massive amounts of thinking, discussing, doing, dreaming, and being accountable to one another, the community, and the universe at large. 

## What is diffractive reading?
In this course, diffractive reading means examining how different materials and perspectives reshape one another when they come into contact. Rather than treating math, art, code, and lived experience as separate domains, we will read them through each other to notice interference patterns: places where meanings overlap, clash, or generate new possibilities. A diffractive approach helps us see that “math” is not just an abstract set of symbols; it becomes something different depending on the stories, tools, institutions, and bodies involved. Our goal is not to decide the single correct definition of math, but to develop practices for noticing what math does in the world and for building new capacities to think, make, and relate across disciplines.

## Course Purpose
The purpose of this course is to learn to "see" diffractively as a method for resiliency and agency and to develop an affirmative ethics as a mechanism of access to silo-ed knowledge.

## Course Goals

After taking this course, students will be able to:
1. 	Approach math and other things with the question, "what does it do?"
2. 	Learn to apply your own lens to things (ideas/concepts/equations) presented to you in order to negotiate your own relationships with the thing.
3.	Learn to recognize and understand the lenses other people use to present things (ideas/concepts/equations) to you and make decisions about if, when, how, and how much to incorporate other people's lenses into your own. 
4. 	Learn to find something in "math", not necessarily math education, that is relevant and useful for you.
