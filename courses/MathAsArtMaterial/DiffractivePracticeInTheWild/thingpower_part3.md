### Part Three: ***Map Exercise-Making***
##### Instructions
-From your list of potential art works from Part One, choose 3.\
-Draw your own maps to your 3 chosen artworks. If they are close together you can make one large map.\
-The map should be hand drawn on a large piece of paper. Later you will need to take notes on the same paper so keep some open space or plan to attach more paper to the sides later to make a larger surface to work with.\
-On your map, write brief reminders of what the terms thing-power, assemblage, and actant mean.
