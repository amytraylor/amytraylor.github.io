    Jane Bennett, <em>Vibrant Matter</em> (PDF)
  </a>

Peruse the whole text, but focus on pages:
- 349-351, where Bennett tells the story of the glove, the rat, and the bottle cap and begins to define thing-power
- 353-354, start again at Thing-Power III: Conjunctions, where Bennett defines the term "assemblage"
- 354- first paragraph on page 355, more defining of thing-power and begins to define the term "actant"
- 356- 359, start at A Naive Moment on page 356, skim until you get to page 358. Read 358 and 359 thoroughly.
