THEORY AND THE NONHUMAN

THE FORCE OF THINGS
Steps toward an Ecology of Matter

JANE BENNETT
Johns Hopkins University

This essay seeks to give philosophical expression to the vitality, willfullness, and recalcitrance
possessed by nonhuman entities and forces. It also considers the ethico-political import of an
enhanced awareness of “thing-power.” Drawing from Lucretius, Spinoza, Gilles Deleuze, Bruno
Latour, and others, it describes a materialism of lively matter, to be placed in conversation with
the historical materialism of Marx and the body materialism of feminist and cultural studies.
Thing-power materialism is a speculative onto-story, an admittedly presumptuous attempt to
depict the nonhumanity that flows around and through humans, The essay concludes with a pre-
liminary discussion of the ecological implications of thing-power

CONTENDING MATERIALITIES

In the early 1990s a literature professor I had just met asked me what I was
working on, and I said I was writing a book on Henry Thoreau, whose interest
in the Wild seemed to me to foreshadow Foucault’s concern with otherness.
My new friend replied that she didn’t much care for Foucault, who “lacked a
materialist perspective.” At the time, I took this reply simply as her way of let-
ting me know that she was committed to a Marx-inspired politics. But the
comment stuck, and eventually provoked these thoughts: How did Marx’s
notion of materiality—as economic structures and exchanges—come to
stand in for “a materialist perspective” per se? Why wasn’t there a livelier
debate among contending theories of materiality?

Since that time, there has been an explosion of political-theoretical work
on the (human) body as a materiality, indebted to, among others, Merleau-
Ponty, Foucault, Luce Irigaray, and Judith Butler. One hallmark of this “body
materialism” (as I will call it) is its insistence upon locating the body inside a
culture or bio-culture. It has examined the micro- and macro-political forces
through which the (human) body is, among other things, gendered, sexed,
pacified, and excited. Body materialism, in other words, reveals how cultural
practices shape what is experienced as natural or real.° Some of this genea-
logical work also insists upon the material recalcitrance of cultural products.
Sexuality, for example, is shown to be a congealed bodily effect of historical
norms and practices, but its status as a human artifact does not imply that it
yields readily to human understanding or control. The point here is that cul-
tural forms are themselves material assemblages that resist.°

My essay takes off from that last insight: it features the recalcitrance or
moment of vitality in things. But unlike the general aim of the body material-
ists, | want to give voice to a less specifically human kind of materiality, to
make manifest what I call “thing-power.” J do so in order to explore the possi-
bility that attentiveness to (nonhuman) things and their powers can have a
laudable effect on humans. (I am not utterly uninterested in humans.) In par-
ticular, might, as Thoreau suggested, sensitivity to thing-power induce a
stronger ecological sense?

The thing-power materialism I am trying to develop draws from various
sources. In the background is, again, Thoreau’s notion of the Wild, that is, his
idea that there is an existence peculiar to a thing that is irreducible to the
thing’s imbrication with human subjectivity. It is due to this otherness or
wildness, says Thoreau, that things have the power to addle and rearrange
thoughts and perceptions. In the foreground is a Lucretian figuration of mate-
riality as capable of free or aleatory movements; a non-Newtonian picture of
Bennett / STEPS TOWARD AN ECOLOGY OF MATTER =. 349

nature as matter-flow, especially as it is developed in the thought of Gilles
Deleuze; and the Spinozist idea that bodies have a propensity to form collec-
tivities. To illustrate the affinities between organic and inorganic matter, I cite
examples from everyday life, or what Thomas Dumm calls “the ordinary,” as
well as from fiction, phenomenology, and natural science.

Thing-power materialism is a speculative onto-story, a rather presumptu-
ous attempt to depict the nonhumanity that flows around but also through
humans. Such a project violates Theodor Adorno’s warning against the vio-
lent hubris of Western philosophy, which consistently fails to acknowledge
the gap between concept and thing. For Adorno, the very most that can be
said about the thing is that it refuses to be captured entirely by any concept,
that there is always a “nonidentity” between the two. A materialism like
mine, which fleshes out an ontological imaginary of things and their powers,
is for him nothing but an arrogant failure to respect the inherent obscurity of
the thing. In response, I argue that projecting a moment of “naive realism”
into one’s political theory may foster greater ethical appreciation of thing-
power, an appreciation that I try, in a preliminary way, to tie to an ecological
project of sustainability.

Thing-power materialism figures materiality as a protean flow of matter-
energy and figures the thing as a relatively composed form of that flow. It
hazards an account of materiality even though materiality is both too alien
and too close for humans to see clearly. It seeks to promote acknowledgment,
respect, and sometimes fear of the materiality of the thing and to articulate
ways in. which human being and thinghood overlap. It emphasizes those
occasions in ordinary life when the us and the it slipslide into each other, for
one moral of this materialist tale is that we are also nonhuman and that things
too are vital players in the world. Like Thoreau, I hope to enhance my recep-
tivity to thing-power by writing about it, by giving an account of the thing-
ness of things that might enable me to feel it more intensely. I pursue this pro-
ject in the hope of fostering greater recognition of the agential powers of nat-
ural and artifactual things, greater awareness of the dense web of their con-
nections with each other and with human bodies, and, finally, a more
cautious, intelligent approach to our interventions in that ecology.

THING-POWER I: TRASH

On a sunny Tuesday morning, June 4, 2002, in the grate over the storm
drain to the Chesapeake Bay in front of Sam’s Bagels on Cold Spring Lane
(which was being repaved), there was
350 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2004

one large men’s black plastic work glove
a matted mass of tree pollen pods

one dead rat who looked asleep

one white plastic bottle cap

one smooth stick of wood

As I looked at these items, they shimmied back and forth between trash
and thing—between, on one hand, stuff to ignore (notable only as a residue of
human action and inaction: the litterer’s incivility, the neighbor’s failure to
keep the storm drain clear, Sam’s vermin-eradication efforts, the Department
of Public Works’ road maintenance schedule) and, on the other hand, stuff
that commands attention as vital and alive in its own right, as an existant in
excess of its reference to human flaws or projects. The second kind of stuff
has thing-power: it commands attention, exudes a kind of dignity, provokes
poetry, or inspires fear.

I was struck by the singular materiality of the glove, the rat, the bottle
cap—a singularity brought to light by the contingency of their co-presence,
by the specific assemblage they formed.* For had the sun not glinted on the
black glove, I might not have seen the rat; had the rat not been there, I might
not have noted the bottle cap, and so on, But they were all there just as they
were, and so I caught a glimpse of an energetic substantiality possessed by
each of these things, things that I generally saw as inert. This opening was
made possible by the fortuity of that particular configuration, but also, per-
haps, by a certain anticipatory readiness—a perceptual style congenial to the
possibility of thing-power. For I came upon the glove-pod-rat-cap-stick with
Thoreau in my head, who had encouraged me to practice “the discipline of
looking always at what is to be seen,” and also with Merleau-Ponty, whose
Phenomenology of Perception had disclosed “‘an immanent or incipient sig-
nificance in the living body [which] extends, . . .to the whole sensible world,”
and had shown me how “our gaze, prompted by the experience of our own
body, will discover in all other ‘objects’ the miracle of expression.”””

J] was struck as well by the way the glove, rat, cap oscillated: at one
moment garbage, at the next stuff that made a claim on me. Is trash stuff
whose power to move, speak, or make a difference has become dormant or
dead? (As so it is buried in the landfill or cast adrift onto the Chesapeake?)
Trash, garbage, litter, dirt, debris, filth, refuse, detritus, rubbish, junk: materi-
alities without their thing-power. A “materialistic” way of life—insofar as it
requires buying ever-increasing numbers of products purchased in ever-
shorter cycles—thus displays an anti-materiality bias. In other words, the
sheer volume of products, and the necessity of junking them to make room
for new ones, devalues the thing.'' It disables and obscures thing-power.
After all, itis hard to discern, much less acknowledge, the material dignity of
Bennett / STEPS TOWARD AN ECOLOGY OF MATTER = 351

the thing when your nose is overwhelmed by the dozens of scents that “have
collected into strata in the department store air”’” or when your thoughts are
scrambled by the miles of shelving at a superstore. There is a way, then, in
which American materialism is antimateriality. Too much stuff in too quick
succession equals the fast ride from object to trash.

Trash, garbage, litter, dirt, debris, filth, refuse, detritus, rubbish, junk.
Compare the effect of that list to this mise-en-scéne: on an asphalt platform, a
shiny black glove rests on a pollen mat, a prone rat in the foreground, bright
plastic cap and smooth wooden stick to the left. Here each thing is individu-
ated, but also located within an assemblage—each is shown to be in a rela-
tionship with the others, and also with the sunlight and the street, and not sim-
ply with me, my vision, or my cultural frame. Here thing-power rises to the
surface. In this assemblage, objects appear more vividly as things, that is, as
entities not entirely reducible to the contexts in which (human) subjects set
them, never entirely exhausted by their semiotics. To encounter the gutter on
Cold Spring Lane as a mise-en-scéne rather than as trash is to glimpse a cul-
ture of things irreducible to the culture of objects. It is to become better able
“to be surprised by what we see.”””

Flower Power, Black Power, Girl Power. Thing Power: the curious ability
of inanimate things to animate, to act, to produce effects dramatic and subtle.

THING-POWER II: CREATIVE SELF-ORGANIZATION

Thing-power is a force exercised by that which is not specifically human
(or even organic) upon humans. The dead rat stopped me in my tracks, as did
the plastic cap and the wooden stick. But the suspicion remains: was this cap-
tivating power ultimately a function of the subjective and intersubjective con-
notations, memories, and affects that had accumulated around my idea of
these items? Was my immobilization simply the result of my sudden recol-
lection of the web of cultural meanings associated with the images “rat,”
“plastic,” “wood”? It could be. But what if all the swarming activity inside
my head was itself an expression of a motility inherent to materiality per se?
In support of the latter view, Manuel De Landa describes the power of
nonhuman materiality to “self-organize”’:

inorganic matter-energy has a wider range of alternatives for the generation of structure
than just simple phase transitions. . . . In other words, even the humblest forms of matter
and energy have the potential for self-organization beyond the relatively simple type
involved in the creation of crystals. There are, for instance, those coherent waves called
solitons which form in many different types of materials, ranging from ocean waters
(where they are called tsunamis) to lasers. Then there are... stable states (or attractors),
352 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2004

which can sustain coherent cyclic activity. .. . Finally, and unlike the previous examples
of nonlinear self-organization where true innovation cannot occur, there {are}... the dif-
ferent combinations into which entities derived from the previous processes (crystals,
coherent pulses, cyclic patterns) may enter. When put together, these forms of spontane-
ous structural generation suggest that inorganic matter is much more variable and cre-
ative than we ever imagined. And this insight into matter’s inherent creativity needs to be
fully incorporated into our new materialist philosophies. "4

Kafka’s “Cares of a Family Man” is aless scientific depiction of the power
of things to mobilize and re-form. The protagonist, Odradek, is a spool of
thread who/that can run and laugh. As animate wood, Odradek is the result of
a “spontaneous structural generation” (to use De Landa’s phrase). Like a
soliton, this particular mode of matter-energy resides in a world where the
line between inert matter and vital energy, between animate and inanimate, is
permeable—and where all things, to some degree or other, live on both sides.

The narrator of Kafka’s story has trouble assigning an ontological cate-
gory to Odradek. Is Odradek an artifact? But if so, its purpose is obscure:

it looks like a flat star-shaped spool of thread, and indeed it does seem to have thread
wound upon it; to be sure, these are only old, broken-off bits of thread, knotted and tan-
gled together, of the most varied sorts and colors. . . . One is tempted to believe that the
creature once had some sort of intelligible shape and is now only a broken-down remnant.
Yet this does not seem to be the case; .. . nowhere is there an unfinished or unbroken sur-
face to suggest anything of the kind: the whole thing looks senseless enough, but in its
own way perfectly finished.

Or is Odradek a living creature, a little person? But if so, his embodiment is
unlike that of any other person we’ve encountered. From the center of
Odradek’s star there protrudes a small wooden crossbar, and “by means of
this latter rod... and one of the points of the star... , the whole thing can
stand upright as if on two legs.” And Odradek not only stands, he is “extraor-
dinarily nimble”:

He lurks by turns in the garret, the stairway, the lobbies, the entrance hall. Often for
months on end he is not to be seen; then he has presumably moved into other houses; but
he always comes faithfully back to our house again. Many a time when you go out of the
door and he happens just to be leaning directly beneath you against the banisters you feel
inclined to speak to him, Of course, you put no difficult questions to him, you treat him—
he is so diminutive that you cannot help it—rather like a child. “Well, what’s your name?”
you ask him, “Odradek,” he says. “And where do you live?” “No fixed abode,” he says
and laughs; but it is only the kind of laughter that has no lungs behind it. It sounds rather
like the rustling of fallen leaves. And that is usually the end of the conversation. Even
these answers are not always forthcoming; often he stays mute for a long time, as wooden
as his appearance.!
Bennett / STEPS TOWARD AN ECOLOGY OF MATTER = 353

Like De Landa and Kafka, the Russian scientist Vladimir Ivanovich
Vernadsky (1863-45) also refused any sharp distinction between life and
matter. Eschewing that dichotomy, he preferred to speak of “living matter.”
Vernadsky “made every attempt to consider life part of other physical pro-
cesses and consistently used the gerund ‘living’ to stress that life was less a
thing and more a happening, a process. Organisms for Vernadsky are special,
distributed forms of the common mineral, water. . .. Emphasizing the conti-
nuity of watery life and rocks, such as that evident in coal or fossil limestone
reefs, Vernadsky noted how these apparently inert strata are ‘traces of bygone
biospheres.””"” Deleuze, invoking Henri Bergson’s Creative Evolution, agrees:
just as there is “a halo of instinct in intelligence, a nebula of intelligence in

instinct,’ there is “a hint of the animate in plants, and of the vegetable in

animals”?

Hylozoism: a doctrine held, especially by early Greek philosophers, but
also by the Jains of India, that all matter has life.

THING-POWER IIT; CONJUNCTIONS

De Landa’s soliton, Kafka’s Odradek, and Vernadsky’s living matter
upset conventional distinctions between matter and life, inorganic and
organic, passive object and active subject. These examples dramatize the
ability of materiality to move across those lines, varying the speed or level of
activity as it migrates from resting to mobile and back. Or, as a Spinozist
might put the point, to adjust its relations of movement and rest in relation to
other bodies. For Spinoza, this capacity is bound up with the fact that every
entity is a “mode” of one ontological substance (call it either God or Nature,
he said). Each human, as one mode, is always in the process of entering into a
set of relationships with other modes. Because this set itself changes over
time (bodies move about, propelled by internal and external forces), to be a
mode is, in turn, to mode-ify and be modified. Nature according to Spinoza is
a place wherein bodies strive to enhance their power of activity by forging
alliances with other bodies in their vicinity (and, in a parallel way, wherein
ideas strive to enhance their power of activity by joining up with other ideas).
This process of mode-ifying is never under the full control of any one body,
for it is always subject to the contingency of aleatory encounters with other
modes. Though one goal of Spinozist ethics is to exercise a greater degree of
self-direction regarding one’s encounters, humans are never outside of a set
of relations with other modes: we may learn to alter the quality of our encoun-
ters but not our encountering nature.’® The relevant point for thinking about
thing-power is this: a material body always resides within some assemblage
354 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2004

or other, and its thing-power is a function of that grouping. A thing has power
by virtue of its operating in conjunction with other things.

Spinoza helps the thing-materialist to rearticulate what is more often con-
ceived as the subject-object relationship: the particular matter-energy forma-
tion that is a human is always engaged in a working relationship with other
formations, some human and some not. Deleuze and Guattari, in a similar
vein, locate humanity within a single cosmic flow of “matter-movement.”
This autopoetic flow is capable of an astonishingly wide variety of mobile
configurations: it is “matter in variation that enter assemblages and leaves
them.” This is not a world, in the first instance, of subjects and objects, but
of various materialities constantly engaged in a network of relations. It is a
world populated less by individuals than by groupings or compositions that
shift over time. For example, the current alliance Jane-keyboard-birdsong
(from the yard outside) will become another ensemble of flesh, plastic, and
sound when, later in the day, I drive in my car to the dentist. And once there,
in the dentist chair, the operative animal-vegetable-mineral-sonority clus-
ter—and its degrees and types of power—wiill again change.

What Spinoza and Deleuze and Guattari here suggest to me is that thing-
power, as a kind of agency, is the property of an assemblage. Thing-power
materialism is a (necessarily speculative) onto-theory that presumes that
matter has an inclination to make connections and form networks of relations
with varying degrees of stability. Here, then, is an affinity between thing-
power materialism and ecological thinking: both advocate the cultivation of
an enhanced sense of the extent to which all things are spun together in a
dense web, and both wam of the self-destructive character of human actions
that are reckless with regard to the other nodes of the web.

THING-POWER IV: ACTANCY

Thing-power entails the ability to shift or vibrate between different states
of being, to go from trash/inanimate/resting to treasure/animate/alert. Thing-
power is also a relational effect, a function of several things operating at the
same time or in conjunction with one another. I experienced a bit of this
thing-power recently while serving on a jury. There I encountered the Gun
Powder Residue Sampler. A small glass vial topped with an adhesive-
covered metal disk, the Sampler was dabbed on the suspect’s hand and then
proferred microscopic evidence that the hand had fired a gun or been within
three feet of a gun firing. The Sampler was shown to the jury twice by expert
witnesses and mentioned many times during the course of the trial, each time
Bennett / STEPS TOWARD AN ECOLOGY OF MATTER = 355

gaining power. This small, at first apparently inert, arrangement of glass,
metal, and glue began to present itself as what Bruno Latour calls an “actant.”

Unlike the term “actor,” an actant can be either human or nonhuman: it is
that which does something, has sufficient coherence to perform actions, pro-
duce effects, and alter situations. Sometimes, says Latour, as in laboratory
experiments, a proto-actant emerges that does not yet have a stabilized iden-
tity and is thus describable only as a list of effects or performances. Here the
term “name of action” is more appropriate than actant, for “only later does
one deduce from these performances a competence,” that is, an entity con-
gealed enough to make a difference in the situation.” Latour strives to
develop a vocabulary to better capture the multiple modalities and degrees of
agency. Agency appears to him as a continuum, as a power differentially
expressed by all material bodies.

The idea of agency as acontinuum seems also to be present in the notion of
“deodand,” a figure of English law from about 1200 until its abolishment in
1846. In cases of accidental death or serious injury to a human, the evil thing
involved—the knife that pierced the flesh or the carriage that trampled the
leg—became deodand or “that which must be given to God.” Deodand, “sus-
pended between human and thing,” designated the instrument of death or
destruction. In what can be seen as recognition of its peculiar kind of culpa-
bility, the deodand had to be surrendered to the Crown in order to be used (or
sold) to compensate for the harm done by its movement or presence. Accord-
ing to William Pietz, “any culture must establish some procedure of compen-
sation, expiation, or punishment to settle the debt created by unintended
human deaths whose direct cause is not a morally accountable person, but a
nonhuman material object. This was the issue thematized in public discourse
by ... the law of deodand.””

There is of course a difference between the knife that impaled a man and
the man impaled, and between the technician who dabs the Sampler and the
Sampler. But the thing-power materialist agrees with John Frow that this dif-
ference “needs to be flattened, read horizontally as a juxtaposition rather than
vertically as a hierarchy of being. It’s a feature of our world that we can and
do distinguish . . . things from persons. But the sort of world we live in makes
it constantly possible for these two sets of kinds to exchange properties.”

The rat body, the bottle cap, Odradek, soliton, deodand. Or the self-
levitating plates and napkins of Balzac’s Peau de Chagrin: there was a “white
tablecloth, like a covering of snow newly fallen, from which rose symmetri-
cally the plates and napkins crowned with light-coloured rolls.””* Or the
human body and its “motor intentionality,” a kind of directionality inside the
motion of an arm or hand that is not reducible, says Merleau-Ponty, to any
356 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2004

subjective or self-conscious decision. For him, the body possesses the very
quality, that is, intentionality, for which the category of mind was invented.”
Or the thing-power of Nike shoes: they can produce narapathy in the bodies
of factory workers as well aesthetic pleasure in the viewers of its 2002
“Move” television commercial, which is filmed so as to reveal uncanny simi-
larities between bodies in motion, be they basketballs and gymnasts or a
group of cyclists and a flock of birds.”

Today the tendency is to refer all expressions of thing-power back to a
human operation conceived as its ultimate source—to, for example, the.cul-
tural meanings invested in a rat, the no-return/no-deposit policy governing
the bottle cap, or the corporate greed oozing from the N ikes. But what if we
slowed this crossing from thing to human culture in order to reach a more
complex understanding of their relationship? To help us, we might paradoxi-
cally recall a more naive orientation to the thing. I turn briefly to the ancient

materialism of Lucretius.

A NAIVE MOMENT

In his De Rerum Natura, Lucretius, Roman devotee of Epicurus, asserts
that every real and potential thing is material. There is no supernatural arena,
no immortal soul. Though we sometimes experience things as if they were
“of” the spirit, this is only because we are embodied in such a way as to be
unable to sense some kinds and collections of matter. For Lucretian material-
ism, there are bodies and void (the space in which they move), and that’s it.
As we shall see, the matter imagined in this materialism is not the lifeless
stuff of mechanistic theories of nature, but more like the vital force. of
Spinoza’s natura naturans, a materiality that is always in the process of rein-
venting itself, which William Connolly has described as “a world of diverse
energies and strange vitalities that whirls around and through [us].””8 I will
return to this lively materiality later; I’d like to focus now on Lucretius’s will-
ingness to hazard an account of matter at all, on his bold attempt to describe a
something that subsists below anything specifically human (even as that mat-
ter also constitutes human bodies and ideas). De Rerum Natura depicts a
world that preexists our arrival, constitutes our present, and would endure our
departure. It claims to reveal the blueprint of being: here are the smallest con-
stituent parts of being (material atoms or “primordia”), and here are the prin-
ciples of association governing them. It rejects religion and disempowers the
gods, presents death as a reconfiguration of primordia made necessary by the
essential motility of matter, and offers advice on how to live well while exist-
ing in one’s current material form. De Rerum Natura is at once a book of
Bennett / STEPS TOWARD AN ECOLOGY OF MATTER = (357

physics, ontology, and ethics. I admire Lucretius’s audacity: he claims to
describe the world as it is with or without us, for the most part ignoring the
mediating role and idiosyncratic status of his perceptions, his Latin, his
“paganism.”

It’s hard to get away with that today. Contemporary materialists must con-
tend with a well-established critique of the “naive realist” claim to get under-
neath, behind, or in front of the mediating screens of subjectivity, cultural
formations, and perceptual biases. The realist quests for the thing itself, say
the critics, but there is no there there-—or, at least, no way for us to grasp it or
know it. Adorno, for example, applies the criticism to Heidegger:

Realism seeks to breach the walls which thought has built around itself, to pierce
the interjected layer of subjective positions that have become a second nature... .
Heidegger’s realism turns a somersault: his aim is to philosophize formlessly, so to speak,
purely on the ground of things, with the result that things evaporate for him. Weary of the
subjective jail of cognition, he becomes convinced that what is transcendent to subjectiv-
ity is immediate for subjectivity, without being conceptually stained by subjectivity.

Adorno insists, as do the “body materialists” cited at the start of this essay,
that things are always already humanized objects. This object status arises
the very instant something comes into our awareness or under our gaze. For
Marx, too, naive realism was the philosophy to overcome. He wrote his doc-
toral dissertation on the “metaphysical materialism” of the Epicureans, and it
was partly against its naivete and abstraction that he would eventually define
his own new “historical materialism.” Historical materialism would not be a
phantasmatic ontological tale but a real social theory; it would focus not on
matter per se but on concrete, social materialities. Marx and Adomo them-
selves eschew any (explicit) ontology, they refuse to detach materiality
from humanity, and they seek to discredit as “naive” materialisms that do
otherwise.

My view is that while humans do indeed encounter things only in a medi-
ated way, there nonetheless remains something to be said for the naivete of
naive realism. A moment of naivete is, I think, indispensable for any discern-
ment of thing-power, if there is to be any chance of acknowledging the force
of matter. A naive realism (which, in my case functions as an onto-story
rather than an apodictic account) allows nonhumanity to appear on the ethical
radar screen. Yes, there is a sense in which any thing-power discerned is an
effect of culture, and this insight is a valuable counter to moralistic appeals to
“nature.” But concentration on this insight alone also diminishes any poten-
tial we might possess to render more manifest the world of nonhuman
vitality.
358 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2004

To “render manifest” is both to receive and to participate in the shape
given to that which is received. What is manifest arrives through humans but
not entirely because of them: we bring something from ourselves to the expe-
rience, and so it is not pure or unmediated. But a receptive mood with a
moment of naivete is a useful counter to the tendency (prevalent in sociologi-
cal and anthropological studies of material culture) to conclude the biogra-
phy of an object by showing how it, like everything, is socially constituted.
To pursue an ecology of things is sometimes to resist that punch line, to elide
its truth, for it inclines thinking and perception too much toward the primacy
of humans and “the subject.” Lucretius’s poem, in contrast, gives center stage
to the power of the specifically nonhuman dimension of humans and other
things; it gives greater latitude to the capacity of things to move, threaten,
inspire, and animate the more obviously animated things called humans.
There is an advantage, then, to this naive realism: it “disavows . . . the tropo-
logical work, the psychological work, and the phenomenological work
entailed in the human production of materiality as such. It does so, however,
in the name of avowing the force of questions that have been too readily fore-
closed by more familiar fetishizations: the fetishization of the subject, the
image, the word.”

Such a naive realism takes human fascination with objects as a clue to the
secret life of nonhumans. It seeks the holy grail of the materiality of the rat
body, the bottle cap, the wooden stick. It pursues the “actancy” of materiality.
The primordia of Lucretius, for example, possess an amplitude of agency, a
lively power to enter into new combinations, to make a difference and make
things happen. These matter-bits are said to fall endlessly through a void,
though every now and then, without warning and at no regular interval, they
swerve from their downward path, bump into others, and thus form the
assemblages that constitute the things around and in us:

at times quite undetermined and at undetermined spots they push a little from their path:
yet only just so much as you could call a change of trend. [For if they did not] ... swerve,
all things would fall downwards through the deep void like drops of rain, nor could colli-
sion come to be, nor a blow brought to pass for the primordia: so nature would never have
brought anything into existence.

Lucretius’s assertion of a primordial swerve in matter says that the world is
not determined, that an element of chanciness resides in the nature of things.
It also affirms that so-called inanimate things have a life of their own, that
deep within them is an inexplicable vitality or energy, a moment of independ-
ence from and resistance to us and other things. A kind of thing-power.
Bennett /STEPS TOWARD AN'ECOLOGY OF MATTER = 359

Deleuze and Guattari allude to the swerve when they say that that which
has a body by that very token has a spiritedness (an esprit de corps), and even
a kind of thrust or directionality (a nomos).** There is also an interesting rela-
tionship to be explored between the swerve and Henri Bergson’s elan vital.”
Finally, a group of neo-Marxists calling themselves “aleatory materialists”
endorse a modified version of hylozoism. They argue that because classical
Marxism’s image of the structure of capitalism is more rigid and impervious
than many contemporary forms of power seem to be, materialism today must
rework the view of nature and history inherited from Marx by acknowledging
something like a surprising swerve in matter.** According to Antonio Negri,
for example, “aleatory materialism is a “completely naked’ materialism,” one
no longer conceived as the economic base of a social structure but rather as a
shimmering and inherently unpredictable “horizon of presence.”

The materialisms of Lucretius, Deleuze, and Negri are impertinent: they
dare to speak of things as if from the perspective of the (cheeky) entities
themselves. They reserve a place in theory for the aleatory and in so doing
display a kind of respect for the cunning thing-power of things. And they do
so in part through a willingness to indulge in a moment of naivete.**

WALKING, TALKING MINERALS

Thing-power materialism offers a contestable but, I think, auspicious
account.of how it is that things have the power to move humans, the beings
who—in accounts that emphasize Augustinian free will or Kantian auton-
omy or Hegelian self-consciousness—are figured as self-movers. It empha-
sizes the shared material basis, the kinship, of all things, regardless of their
status as human, animal, vegetable, or mineral. It does not deny that there are
differences between human and nonhuman, though it strives to describe them
without succumbing to the temptation to place humans at the ontological
center. One way to do so is to distinguish humans as things composed of a
particularly rich and complex collection of materiality.” In Jean-Francois
Lyotard’s “Postmodern Fable,” for example, “humankind is taken for a com-
plex material system; consciousness, for an effect of language; and language
for a highly complex material system”; Richard Rorty also suggests that
human beings are more complex animals, rather than animals “with an extra
added ingredient called ‘intellect’ or ‘the rational soul.’’*8 Vernadsky sees
humans as a particularly potent mix of minerals, as Lynn Margulis’s sum-
mary shows:
360 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2004

What struck [Vernadsky] most was that the material of Earth’s crust has been packaged
into myriad moving beings whose reproduction and growth build and break down matter
ona global scale. People, for example, redistribute and concentrate oxygen... and other
elements of Earth’s crust into two-legged, upright forms that have an amazing propensity
to wander across, dig into and in countless other ways alter Earth’s surface. We are walk-

ing, talking minerals?

Thing materialism emphasizes the kinship between people and things. So
far, the case for that kinship has proceeded primarily by presenting non-
humanity as an active actant. But to make the case for kinship, must itnot also
be shown how humanity participates in thinghood? De Landa cites bone as an
example of our interior inorganicism; bone reveals one way in which we are
not only animal and vegetable, but also mineral:

_.. Soft tissue (gels and aerosols, muscle and nerve) reigned supreme until 5000 million
years ago. At that point, some of the conglomerations of fleshy matter-energy that made
up life underwent a sudden mineralization, and a new material for constructing living
creatures emerge: bone. Itis almostas if the mineral world that had served as a substratum
for the emergence of biological creatures was reasserting itself,

The emergence of bone “made new forms of movement control possible
among animals, freeing them from many constraints and literally setting
them into motion to conquer every available niche in the air, in water, and on
land’! Here bone is a mover and shaker, mineralization an agent. There is a
sense in which we are its object, and improved in our own agency as a result.
Or perhaps it is most accurate to say that agency is a property less of individ-
ual entities than of assemblages of humans and nonhumans.

The view that there is a thing-ness to humans, that the human contains no
distinct substance, but shares the elan vital of less complexly or differently
organized things, risks being used as a justification for the instrumental use of
persons, for their objectification or commodification. Of course, what is
immoral here is the goal of domination, not the act of recognizing the pres-
ence of the nonhuman within the human. But the danger of a harmful or cruel
instrumentalism is real. It might, however, be mitigated when the blurring of
the human/nonhuman distinction is combined with the attempt to enhance
the ethical standing of things. The danger of reducing subjects to “mere
objects” is most acute, I think, in a materialism in which things are always
already on their way to becoming trash (where materiality is conceived as the
dead other to life). Thing-power materialism, in contrast, figures things as
being more than mere objects, emphasizing their powers of life, resistance,
and even a kind of will; these are powers that, in a tightly knit world, we
ignore at our own peril. The perspective I am pursuing does not reject self-
Bennett / STEPS TOWARD AN ECOLOGY OF MATTER = 361

interest as one motivation for ethical behavior, nor does it think it possible to
eliminate completely the conceptual “enframing” that Heidegger criticizes.
Rather, it seeks to cultivate a more enlightened self-interest, one cognizant of
our embeddedness in a natural-cultural-technological assemblage. Even
such an enlightened understanding of interest is not always sufficient to pro-
voke ethical behavior toward other bodies. Ethical motivation needs also to
draw upon co-feeling or sympathy with suffering, and also upon a certain
love of the world, or enchantment with it. This last source is best inspired, I
think, by an onto-tale that enhances one’s awareness of the vitality of the
world with which one is enmeshed. Again, it must be said that the relation
between an ontology and an ethic is always loose, though the relation is
rendered less indeterminate when the temper in which the ontology is lived is
considered.

NEGATIVITY AND THINGS

Because the human too is a materiality, it possesses a thing-power of its
own. This thing-power sometimes makes itself known as an uneasy feeling of
internal resistance, as an alien presence that is uncannily familiar. Perhaps
this is what Socrates referred to as his daemon or nay-saying gadfly.” Recent
work in cultural theory has highlighted this force that is experienced as in but
not quite of oneself. This indeterminate and never fully determinable dimen-
sion of things has been called differance (Jacques Derrida), the virtual (Gilles
Deleuze), the invisible (Maurice Merleau-Ponty), the semiotic (Julia
Kristeva), and nonidentity (Theodor Adorno). J ean-Francois Lyotard
describes this obstinate remainder, which hovers between the ontological
and the epistemological registers, as “that which exceeds every putting into
form or object without being anywhere else but within them’ “3 These various
terms of art mark the fact that thing-power often first reveals itself as a
negativity, a confounding or fouling up of an intention, desire, schema, or
concept. But, as many of the thinkers named above have noted, such
negativity is also the same stuff out of which positive things emerge. It is a
negativity that is profoundly productive: the materiality that resists us is also
the protean source of being, the essentially vague matrix of things.“

In the work of Derrida, Deleuze, Merleau-Ponty, Kristeva, and Adorno,
we find accounts of materiality pitched at the same level as that offered by De
Rerum Natura. These more recent onto-tales differ from Lucretius’s, how-
ever, in their greater focus on the difficulty, even impossibility, of compre-
hending materiality. Adorno has perhaps gone furthest here: he speaks of the
resistance as “nonidentity,” or the persistent lack of fit between concept and
362 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2004

thing. Nonidentity is what is “heterogeneous” to all concepts, and it presents

itself as a painful and nagging sense that something’s being forgotten or left

out—despite the vigilance of one’s attentiveness to the thing or the degree of

one’s conceptual refinement. Adorno devises a “negative dialectics” as a way

of honing in on this nonidentity, which, he insists, can never be grasped fully

orreconciled with us. examine negative dialectics in what follows because it

offers an alternative way of conceiving the nonhuman (not as thing-power

but as nonidentity), and because it offers a contending model of what moti- .
vates ethical action (not fascination with a vital material world but the painful

experience of an absent absolute).

Adorno attempts to deploy the negativity of nonidentity—its discomfiting
static buzz—to chasten the human urge to master the world. Negative dialec-
tics is a style of thinking, a pedagogy really, designed to remind us that
“objects do not go into their concepts without leaving a remainder’® but,
more importantly, to teach us how to stop raging against that nonidentty,
against, that is, a world that refuses to offer the “reconcilement’—between
concept and thing, self and other, nature and culture—that we (are said to)
desire, (For the thing-power materialist, the desire for “reconcilement” may
be less pronounced, given that everything is thought already to participate in
a common materiality.*°)

Just as the thing-power materialist practices certain techniques of the self
in order to cultivate perceptual openness to nonhuman forms of vitality and
agency, Adorno recommends practical exercises for training oneself to honor
nonidentity. One such technique is making the process of conceptualization
itself an object of reflection. Concepts always fail to coincide with things and
conceptualization always works to obscure this fact, but critical reflection
can expose the inadequacy of concepts and thus open a tiny window onto the
nonidentity dispersed around them.’” A second technique is to admit the
“playful element” into one’s thinking. The negative dialectician “knows how
far he remains from the object of this thinking, and yet he must always talk as
if he had it entirely. This brings him to the point of clowning. He must not
deny his clownish traits, least of all since they alone can give him hope for
what is denied him’*8 Adorno suggests, finally, that the negative dialectician
should engage in utopian thinking: she imagines emergent possibilities and
does not restrict herself to the examination of existing objects.” Nonidentity
consists in those denied possibilities, in the invisible field that surrounds and
infuses the world of objects.

The self-criticism of conceptualization, the art of clowning, and the exer-
cise of an unrealistic imagination: such practices can lessen the “rage”
against nonidentity, which for Adorno is the driving force behind interhuman
Bennett / STEPS TOWARD AN ECOLOGY OF MATTER —363

acts of cruelty and violence. Going even further, he suggests that negative
dialectics can transmute the anguish of nonidentity into a will to political
action: the object thwarts our desire for conceptual and practical mastery and
the sting of this refusal contains a moral message which the practice of nega-
tive dialectics can decode. The message is “that suffering ought not to be, that
things should be different. ‘Woe speaks: “Go.”’ Hence the convergence of
specific materialism with criticism, with social change in practice.”*°

Adorno does not elaborate how or why the pain of conceptual failure pro-
vokes:a desire to redress the socially induced pain of others. But even if one
grants that the pangs of nonidentity can engender the adage that “things
should be different,” such an awakening of moral judgment often does not
issue in “social change in practice.” In other words, there seems to be a sec-
ond gap, alongside that between concept and thing, that needs to be
addressed: the gap between recognizing the suffering of others and engaging
in ameliorative action. To the thing-power materialist, one powerful source
of the energy required to jump the gap is joy—joy as one expression of the
thing-power of the human body, joy as a animating energy generated in part
by affection for a material world experienced as vital and alive.” The practice
of negative dialectics does not court the joyful affects, but is designed to
enhance feelings of guilt, suffering, and a haunting sense of loss.**

Adorno founds his ethics upon attentiveness to nonidentity, an elusive
force that is discernible, in a dark way, in “the object’s qualitative mom
ents.”> Qualitative singularities can never be fully grasped, of course, and the
best one can do is to “grope” toward “the preponderance of the object.”™
Adorno’s invocation of the object is not a claim about a thing-power distin-
guishable (even in principle) from human subjectivity. It is not the purpose of
negative dialectics, he writes, “to place the object on the orphaned royal
throne once occupied by the subject. On that throne the object would be noth-
ing but an idol.” Adorno insists that the object is accessible only “as it
entwines with subjectivity” and speaks of the object’s “preponderance”
merely as a counter to the dominant philosophical presumption in favor of an
absolute, transcendental subject.*’ But he retains the vocabulary of “subject”
and “object” as a bulwark against the naive realism of a third term, like
“thing,” which is supposed to be reducible to neither. Instead of the specta-
cle of swerving primordia, Adorno offers the mysterious recalcitrance of
nonidentity.? He is extremely cautious about saying anything substantial
about this force; to say too much, to narrativize, would be an act of hubris.
Nonidentity is dark and brooding—it makes itself known, to the extent that it
does, through its mute resistance or infliction of pain.
364. POLITICAL THEORY / June 2004

Adorno’s epistemological task, then, is to better attend to that which is
essentially unknowable. This epistemological task dovetails with an ethical
one: to honor nonidentity as perhaps one would honor an unknowable god,
holy but profoundly mysterious. In the most significant departure from the
thing-power materialism I have been developing, Adorno refuses to confine
nonidentity to an immanent, material world. It is true that nonidentity mani-
fests itself through the experience of bodily pain, but Adorno does not rule
out divinity as a power behind or within this force. Of course, he rejects any
naive picture of transcendence, like that of a loving God who designed the
world. Who can believe this after Auschwitz? he asks. “Metaphysics cannot
rise again,” but the desire for transcendence endures because “nothing could
be experienced as truly alive if something that transcends life were not prom-
ised also... . The transcendent is, and it is not.”°°

Adorno seems, then, to maintain the possibility of transcendence by hon-
oring nonidentity as an absent absolute, as a messianic promise.” A thing-
power materialist might respond by invoking the wondrous energy of actants
as itself sufficient to warrant an honorable relation to things, or to justify the
wisdom of proceeding cautiously in our engagements with the world. To us,
resistances and swerves are less gestures of transcendence than manifesta-
tions of the vitality of immanent forces that flow through us as well as course
over and under us. These forces are not fully knowable or predictable, but
their aleatory dimension is not figured as transcendent. Thing-power materi-
alism, as an adventurous ontological imaginary, offers a picture of matter as
so active, intricate, and awesome, that it’s no disgrace to be made up wholly
of the stuff oneself. In this onto-tale, humans and their thoughts, like other
things, are part of a mobile set of material assemblages, and no term like
“soul” or “spirit” is needed to express the (sometimes noble, sometimes
destructive, sometimes ineffable) complexity of human acts or desires.

Adorno struggles to describe a force that is material in its resistance to
human concepts but spiritual insofar as it is a dark or vague promise of an
absolute-to-come. The thing-power materialist struggles to describe forces
that, though never fully transparent to us, offer no such promise. Its hope is
placed, rather, in the prospect of becoming more awake to the vitality of mat-
ter. There is no definitive way to choose between these two ontological
imaginaries, and that is why some find Adorno’s approach, which explicitly
leaves open the possibility of a divine power of transcendence, preferable toa
materialism that seems to close the question. Nevertheless, despite the theo-
logical difference between a philosophy of nonidentity and a thing-power
materialism, both can be seen as sharing an ethical urge to tread more lightly

upon the earth.
Bennett / STEPS TOWARD AN ECOLOGY OF MATTER — (365

TOWARD AN ECOLOGY OF MATTER

The force of the ordinary . . . can be obscured, reduced, or eliminated .. . by a lack of
appreciation of the richness of its connections to the larger world it composes.

—-—Thomas Dumm®

Ecology can be defined as the study or story (Jogos) of the place where we
live (oikos), or better, the place that we live. For a thing-power materialist,
that place is a dynamic flow of matter-energy that tends to settle into various
bodies, bodies that often join forces, make connections, form alliances. The
Earth, then, is natura naturans, a swarm of productive activity, or, as Deleuze
and Guattari describe it, “an immense Abstract Machine” whose “pieces are
the various assemblages and individuals, each of which groups together an
infinity of particles entering into an infinity of more or less interconnected
relations.” In this ecological tale, “a fiber stretches from a human to an ani-
mal, from a human or an animal to molecules, from molecules to particles,
and so on to the imperceptible.” For a thing-power materialist, humans are
always in composition with nonhumanity, never outside of a sticky web of
connections or an ecology.

Thing-power is the lively energy and/or resistant pressure that issues from
‘one material assemblage and is received by others. Thing-power, in other
words, is immanent in collectives that include humans, the beings best able to
recount the experience of the force of things. Thing-power materialism
emphasizes the closeness, the intimacy, of humans and nonhumans.® And it
is here, in a heightened sense of that mutual implication, that thing-power
materialism can contribute to an ecological ethos. To call something ecologi-
cal is to draw attention to its necessary implication in a network of relations,
to mark its persistent tendency to enter into a working system.” That system,
however, can be more or less mobile, more or less transient, more or less
conflictual: thing-power materialism does not endorse the view, absorbed
from the nineteenth-century roots of the science of ecology by deep ecolo-
gists, that “ecological” means “harmonious” or tending toward equilibrium.
To be ecological is to participate in a collectivity, but not all collectives oper-
ate as organic wholes.

I am not sure just how an increase in recognition of the force of things
would play out in terms of consumption practices. My hope is that it would
increase the deliberateness or intentionality involved—less thoughtless
waste, and so perhaps less waste overall. I do think that a renewed emphasis
on our entanglement with things, an entanglement that renders us susceptible
to an array of dangers and diseases as well as joys and inspirations, is compat-
ible with a “wise use” orientation to consumption. Tread lightly upon the
366 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2004 ‘

earth, both because things are alive and have value as such and because we
should be cautious around things that have the power to do us harm.*”

Thing-power materialism is also compatible with what James Nash
described as the ecological virtue of frugality. Distinguishable from auster-
ity, frugality is a disciplined form of consumption, an “earth-affirming
norm,” a

‘sparing’ in production and consumption—literally sparing of the resources necessary
for human communities and sparing of the other species that are both values in them-
selves and instrumental values for human needs. Frugality minimizes harm to humans
and other lifeforms, enabling thereby a greater thriving of all life. At its best, therefore,
frugality can be described paradoxically as hedonistic self-denial, since it is a sensuous
concern, or, as Alan Durning notes, ‘a true materialism that does not just care about thing,

but cares for them.’

My primary goal has been to give expression to thing-power. This is not
the same as questing for the thing-in-itself. I don’t seek the thing as it stands
alone, but rather the not-fully-humanized dimension of a thing as it manifests
itself amidst other entities and forces. My contention is that this peculiar
dimension persists even inside the ubiquitous framing of human thought and
perception. I have also suggested that a playful, naive stance toward nonhu-
man things is a way for us to render more manifest a fugitive dimension of
experience. In the moment of naivete, it becomes possible to discern a resem-
blance between one’s interior thinghood (e.g., bones) and the object-entities
exterior to one’s body. In the sympathetic link so formed, which also consti-
tutes a line of flight from the anthropocentrism of everyday experience,
thing-power comes to presence.

In developing the idea of thing-power, my aim was to enliven the debate
over materiality—what it is and does. It is important that “materiality” be a
contested term in political theory, especially as it replaces “reality” as the
name for the stuff to which theory must be tied if it is to make a difference.
My friend’s assumption—that there is really only one way to theorize the rel-
evance of materiality to politics—relegates other materialisms to the apoliti-
cal ether of idealism or aestheticism. But thing materialism is, I think, a via-
ble competitor alongside the historical materialism of Marx and the body
materialism of cultural studies. I present it as a contestable figuration of
materiality among others, each of which emphasizes a different set of powers
and does different political work. Historical materialism has tended to
emphasize the structured quality of materiality—its ability to congeal into
economic classes, stratified patterns of work, and dominant practices of
exchange. Its political strength lies in its ability to expose hidden injuries of
class, global economic inequities, and other unjust effects of capital flows
Bennett / STEPS TOWARD AN ECOLOGY OF MATTER = 367

and sedimentations. Body materialism has tended to focus on the Human
body and its collective practices (or arts of the self). It highlights the suscepti-
bility of nature and biology to culture, and it exposes the extent to which cul-
tural notions and ideals are themselves embodied entities and thus materiali-
ties that could be reshaped through politics. Thing-power materialism, for its
part, focuses on energetic forces that course through humans and cultures
without being exhausted by them. It pursues the quixotic task of a material-
ism that is not also an anthropology. Its political potential resides in its ability
to induce a greater sense of interconnectedness between humanity and
nonhumanity. A significant shift here might mobilize the will to move
consumption practices in a more ecologically sustainable direction.

cite. The three volumes of Fragments for a History of the Human Body, edited by Michel Feher
with Ramona Naddaff and Nadia Tazi (New York: Zone Books, 1989) offer one map of the ter-
rain. The first volume explores “the human body’s relationship to the divine, to the bestial and to
the machines that imitate or simulate it”; the second takes a “‘psychosomatic’ approach, studying
the manifestation—or production—of the soul and the expression of the emotions through the
body’s attitudes”; and the third shows “how a certain organ or bodily substance can be used to
justify or challenge the way human society functions and, reciprocally, how a certain political or
social function tends to make the body of the person filling [it] .. .the organ of... . the social body.”

recent feminist thought, see Momin Rahman and Anne Witz, “What Really Matters? The Elusive

Canadian Sociology and Anthropology Association, University of Toronto, May 2002). Rahman

linked to a desire to re-locate questions of sexuality and gender within the sphere of the social and
thus political” (p. 9). Good examples of such work include Judith Butler, Bodies That Matter

which can be thought of, interchangeably, as a body-in-space or as an idea. Bodies and ideas

‘operate in perfect tandem though also perfectly uncontaminated by each other. Spinoza’s paral-
lelism may disqualify him from being classified as a materialist, though bodies and their encoun-
ters do occupy a crucial place in his ontological imaginary. Moreover, Spinoza tends to empha-
size the special status of human bodies/ideas. Human relations of movement and rest have the
unique potential to organize themselves “under the guidance of reason” and be “determined... to
act in a way required by . . . [one’s] own nature considered only in itself” rather than “by things
external.” Baruch Spinoza, Ethics, trans. Samuel Shirley. (New York: Hackett, 1992), 174. This
is why Spinoza says that humans are right to make use of animals as we please and deal with them
as best Suits us, “seeing that they do not agree with us in nature” (p. 174). (Though Spinoza does
say that all bodies are animate in the sense of possessing a conatus or vitalistic drive to
persevere.)

As for Spinoza, Natura naturans, nature as the very activity or process of producing, making,
creating, is the first of two aspects of God-or-Nature in his ontology. The second is natura
naturata, or nature as a system of already produced (or spatialized) things. See Spinoza’s Ethics,
book I, prop 29; see also Seymour Feldman, “Introduction,” in Baruch Spinoza, Ethics (New
York: Hackett, 1992), 11.

33. My thanks to Bill Connolly for introducing me to Bergson, whom I had not read when I
first composed this essay. Since then, Bergson has alerted me to the limitations of an ontological
imaginary presented primarily in terms of bodies-in-space. He argues that there is something
about the very imaginary of bodies-in-space that obscures becoming, that conceals from view the
active and continual morphing in which we are only participants along with other things. For
Bergson, it is not simply that a thing is always changing its physical and cultural locations.
Rather, each “thing,” as a slice of duration, is itself engaged in an internal process of deformation.
Internal differentiation as the way of the world. See Henri Bergson, Matter and Memory (New
York: Zone, 1991) and Creative Evolution (New York: Dover, 1998).

36. Paul Patton pointed out to me that Deleuze described his own work as “naive”:
“[Foucault] may perhaps have meant that I was the most naive philosopher of our generation. In
all of us you find themes like multiplicity, difference, repetition. But I put forward almost raw
concepts of these, while others work with more mediations. P’'ve never worried about going
beyond metaphysics . . . I’ve never renounced a kind of empiricism. . . . Maybe that’s what
Foucault meant: I wasn’t better than the others, but more naive, producing a kind of art brut, so to
speak, not the most profound but the most innocent.” Gilles Deleuze, Negotiations, trans. Martin
Joughin (New York: Columbia University Press, 1995), 88-89.

37. Lucretius, for example, says that “itis right to have this truth . . . surely sealed and to keep
it stored in your remembering mind, that there is not one of all the things, whose nature is seen
before our face, which is built of one kind of primordia, nor anything which is not created of well-
mingled seed. And whatever possesses within it more forces and powers, it thus shows that there
are in it most kinds of primordia and diverse shapes” (II, 581).

behaviour, ... that is brought about by a tiny swerve of atoms.” De Rerum Natura, trans. Long and

45. Adomo, Negative Dialectics, 5. Romand Coles offers a developed interpretation of
Adorno as an ethical theorist: he presents negative dialectics as a “morality of thinking” or a
“mode of conduct” that fosters generosity toward others and toward the nonidentical in oneself.
According to Coles, Adorno’s morality of thinking acknowledges (and thereby begins to miti-
gate) the violence done by conceptualization and the suffering imposed by the quest to know and
control all things. See Romand Coles, Rethinking Generosity (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University
Press, 1997), chap. 2.

46. 1 treat idealism as a historically established position against which thing-power material-
ism is defined even while I resist the image of matter bequeathed to us by idealism.

47, All concepts “refer to nonconceptualities, because concepts on their part are moments of
the reality that requires their formation.” Adorno, Negative Dialectics, 12. Because nonidentity
simply does not avail itself to any immediate relationship, all access to it, however obscure, must
be via the mediation of concepts, But it is possible, says Adorno, to become a “discriminating
man” who “in the matter and its concept can distinguish even the infinitesimal, that which
escapes the concept.” Adorno, Negative Dialectics, 45.

49. “The means employed in negative dialectics for the penetration of its hardened objects is
possibility—the possibility of which their reality has cheated the objects and which is nonethe-
less visible in each one.” Adorno, Negative Dialectics, 52. Diana Coole elaborates this point: “In
aiming for the impossible, [negative dialectics] . . . practices negativity and dwells irredeemably
in the realms of the is-not, yet it thereby practices the very non-identity thinking that exemplifies
the only practicable subject-object reconciliation” Coole, Negativity and Politics, 184-85.

50. Adorno, Negative Dialectics, 202-3. Adorno also describes this pain as the “guilt ofa life
which purely as a fact will strangle other life” (p. 364). Coles calls it the “ongoing discomfort that
solicits our critical efforts.” Coole, Negativity and Politics, 89.

51. | make the case for the ethical role of the positive affects in The Enchantment of Modern

Life, especially in chapters 1 and 7.
_ §2. Adorno himself discerns no such ethical potential in moments of joy or in the attachment
to life that they can induce. For him, the feeling of “the fullness of life” can only be an illusion ina
world whose essential characteristic is the gap of nonidentity and, ultimately, death. Adorno
identifies with Kant, who “disdained the passage to affirmation,” and rejects those who offer
“positivities” for this world, for “no reforms . . . [can ever suffice] . . . to do justice to the
dead, ... none of them [touch]... upon the wrong of death.” Adorno, Negative Dialectics, 385.
What is more, the joyful passions are all bound up with the desire for domination, the very thing
that negative dialectics seeks to combat: the idea of fullness of life “is inseparable from. ..a
desire in which violence and subjugation are inherent. . . , There is no fullness without biceps-
flexing.” Adorno, Negative Dialectics, 378. From the perspective of the thing-power materialist,
Adorno teeters on the edge of what Dumm describes as “the overwhelming sense of loss that
could swamp us when we approach [the thing’s] unknowable vastness.” Dumm, Politics of the
Ordinary, 169, emphasis added.

53. Adorno, Negative Dialectics, 43.

rendered materialistic” (p. 192).

57. “Preponderance of the object is a thought of which any pretentious philosophy will be
suspicious. .. . [Such] protestations . .. seek to drown out the festering suspicion that heteronomy
might be mightier than the autonomy of which Kant... taught... Such philosophical subjectiv-
ism is the ideological accompaniment of the . . . bourgeois I.” Ibid., 189.

58. Ibid., 174-75.

59, “What we may call the thing itself is not positively and immediately at hand. He who
wants to know it must think more, not less... . It is nonidentity through identity” Ibid., 189.

60, Ibid., 404, 375. The gap between concept and thing can never be closed, and withstanding
this unconcilement is possible for Adorno, according to Albrecht Wellmer, only “in the name of
an absolute, which, although itis veiled in black, is not nothing. Between the being and the non-
being of the absolute there remains an infinitely narrow crack through which a glimmer of light
falls upon the world, the light of an absolute which is yet to come into being.” Albrecht Wellmer,
Endgames: The Irreconcilable Nature of Modernity, trans. David Midgley (Cambridge, MA:
MIT Press, 1998), 171, emphasis added.

61. Thanks to Lars Tonder for alerting me to the messianic dimension of Adomo’s thinking. It
is also relevant to note Adorno’s admiration for Kant, who is said to have found a way to assign
transcendence an important role while making it inaccessible in principle: “What finite beings
say about transcendence is the semblance of transcendence; but as Kant well knew, it is a neces-
sary semblance. Hence the incomparable metaphysical relevance of the rescue of semblance, the
object of esthetics.” Negative Dialectics, 393. For Adorno, “the idea of truth is supreme among
372 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2004

the metaphysical ideas, and this is why... one who believes in God cannot believe in God, why
the possibility represented by the divine name is maintained, rather, by him who does not
believe.” Negative Dialectics, 401-2. According to Coles, it does not matter to Adorno whether
the transcendent realm actually exists, what matters is the “demand . . . placed on thought” by its
promise. Coles, Rethinking Generosity, 114.

62, My thanks to Morton Schoolman for this point. Schoolman develops this reading of
Adorno, and links Adorno’s thought to the project of democratic individuality, in Reason and
Horror (New York: Routledge, 2001).

65. 've tried to avoid conceiving of that relationship in terms of “subjects” and “objects,”
though I have come to see that such a formulation is not entirely dispensable.

66. The modern use of the term “ecology” “came from Darwin through Emst Haeckel,
who ... spoke of ‘nature’s Economy’ (1866) with reference to interrelationships and interactions
among competing organisms in a community.” Joseph M. Petulla, American Environmentalism
(College Station, TX: Texas A&M University Press, | 980), 31-32. Arnold Berleant argues that in
recent years the scope of the ecological has enlarged: “The notion of an ecosystem has expanded
the organism-environmentinteraction to encompass an entire community of bacteria, plants, and
animals, joined with the physical, chemical, and geographical conditions under which they
live. ... We are slowly beginning to realize that no domain of our planet can any longer be
regarded as an independent and sovereign realm. Indeed, the concept of environment as outside,
external to the human organism, is a comforting notion now utterly discarded both by ecological
studies and post-Cartesian philosophy.” Arnold Berleant, The Aesthetics of Environment
(Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1992), 4-5.
