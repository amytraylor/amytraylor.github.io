THEORY AND THE NONHUMAN

THE FORCE OF THINGS
Steps toward an Ecology of Matter

JANE BENNETT
Johns Hopkins University

This essay seeks to give philosophical expression to the vitality, willfullness, and recalcitrance
possessed by nonhuman entities and forces. It also considers the ethico-political import of an
enhanced awareness of “thing-power.” Drawing from Lucretius, Spinoza, Gilles Deleuze, Bruno
Latour, and others, it describes a materialism of lively matter, to be placed in conversation with
the historical materialism of Marx and the body materialism of feminist and cultural studies.
Thing-power materialism is a speculative onto-story, an admittedly presumptuous attempt to
depict the nonhumanity that flows around and through humans, The essay concludes with a pre-
liminary discussion of the ecological implications of thing-power
